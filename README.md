# Hello-World

Hello World!

I enjoy learning new things and doing new things to freshen my talents!

I have faith that Code Louisville will be great to learn how to code. I already learned to code before and will enjoy learning new coding techniques outside of some Power Bi, Phython and GitHub that I learned earlier this year.
